# Epigenetic-AI
AI platform for ultra-early cancer detection using epigenetic imaging. Organ-agnostic models (brain, heart, bone, etc.) learn subtle biological signatures to classify risk before symptoms appear. Built with modular vision models, evolving toward clinician-ready diagnostics.



🔬 Epigenetic AI for Ultra-Early Cancer Detection

This project develops an AI-driven framework for multi-organ cancer detection using epigenetic imaging signals.
The goal is simple but bold: identify cancer before symptoms appear, enabling earlier intervention and better survival outcomes.

🚀 Vision

Instead of focusing on a single cancer, this platform aims to become organ-agnostic — capable of screening for abnormalities in regions such as:

Brain

Head & Neck

Breast

Bone

Lung

Prostate

Heart and other organs

By modeling epigenetic signatures captured through imaging, we aspire to push screening from late diagnosis to pre-clinical detection.

🧠 What the System Does

Learns epigenetic expression patterns embedded in medical images

Classifies multiple cancer types and anatomical regions

Identifies abnormal signatures indicative of early malignancy

Supports modular plug-in models for new cancer types and modalities

🏗️ Architecture

The platform incorporates:

✔ Imaging pre-processing pipelines
✔ Vision transformer and CNN-based classifiers
✔ Organ-specific detection modules
✔ A general inference engine that routes images to the appropriate cancer model based on clinician input

Future versions will explore simulation layers to mimic progression hypotheses and risk estimation.

💡 Why This Matters

Cancer is often detected only after tissue damage has begun.
If imaging + epigenetic change patterns can be decoded early, screening can shift from reactive to predictive, especially in regions lacking specialist resources.

🔭 Roadmap

Expand datasets per organ type

Improve regional segmentation and feature fusion

Build inference GUI for clinicians

Add explainability visualizations for trust & validation

Investigate potential integration into handheld ultrasound platforms
